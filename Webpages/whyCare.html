                    <h1>A Lack Of Sleep Can Harm Your Kids</h1>
                    <h3>  Sleep deprivation has a myriad of unwanted effects that negatively impact student in school and cause them to be emotionally unstable.</h3>

                
  <p>This claim is supported by a comprehensive review written about previous studies that analyzed the impact of a delayed 
    school start time (Minges and Redeker 87).   In their review, Yale medical professors, Karl E. 
    Minges, and Nancy S. Redeker emphasize the importance of sleep for students, arguing that, 
    Adolescents who are chronically sleep restricted perform academically poorer in morning 
    classes and in overall performance, have increased absenteeism and tardiness, and a 
    decreased ability to learn and retain material, actively participate in class, and perform 
    decision-making tasks. Furthermore, sleep compromised adolescents are also more likely 
    to be depressed, anxious, irritable, defiant, apathetic, and impulsive than adolescents who 
    achieve optimal sleep. (Minges and Redeker 87) </p>

            <h1>Scary But True</h1>
            <h2>A lack of sleep can cause some harrowing side-effects</h2>

                Even burdened with the troubling evidence about the consequences of sleep deprivation, 
it must be demonstrated that a sleep crisis is common in order to constitute a change dramatic as 
moving a school district’s start time forward. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The majority of adolescents do not receive enough 
sleep.  The American Academy of Pediatrics writes that "87% of high school students in the 
United States are getting less than the recommended 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep on school nights" (643). 
 Even more concerning is the fact that over two-thirds of parents were satisfied with the 
amount of sleep their children received (Owens 643).

                If a delayed school start  time could be proven to result in longer sleep, it would be a remedy for this sleep epidemic, 
                allowing adolescents to get the amount of sleep they need to function at their fullest potential.

               <blockquote> “Busy schedules and the overuse of phones, tablets, 
                computers, video games and television have as much, if not more, negative impact on our 
                teenagers’ sleep schedules than the time at which school begins” (Mantz et al). " </blockquote>

               <p> While increased screen time and late-night study sessions may play a role in the amount 
                    of sleep a student receives, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that adolescents do not 
                    have complete control over their sleep habits.  Adolescent's bodies are wired to operate on a 
                    different sleep schedule, causing them to go to bed later (Owens 642). This sleep pattern in 
                    adolescents is biological, and not a result of controllable factors (Owens 642). The  American 
                    Academy of Pediatrics writes, "One factor is delayed timing of nocturnal melatonin secretion 
                    across adolescence that parallels a shift in circadian phase preference from more ‘morning’ type 
                    to more ‘evening’ type, which consequently results in difficulty falling asleep at an earlier bedtime" (Owens 642).</p>
                    
                     
                  <p>Furthermore, The American Academy of Pediatrics says that adolescents 
                    experience an "altered 'sleep drive' across adolescence, in which the pressure to fall asleep 
                    accumulates more slowly" (Owens 642).  In short, adolescents do not have complete control of 
                    their sleep habits, much of which is determined by biological changes (Owens 642).   This 
                    evidence suggests that the school start time delay should be implemented to allow students the 
                    sleep they need to adjust to the biological sleep changes they experience as adolescents.   </p> </div>
