                    <h1>Delayed School Start Times Result In Improved Sleep, Health, and Academics</h1>
                    <h3>There have been numerous studies demonstrating this claim </h3>

  <p style="background-color: rgba(245, 245, 220, 0.281); border-radius: 50px; padding: 20px; border: solid black 2px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Peabody Award winner, and NPR health contributor, Patti Neighmond, reported that a few 
    years ago, Seattle delayed their school start times by an hour, beginning school at 8:45.  She says 
    that although the initial implementation proved challenging, adolescents affected by the change 
    were able to get more sleep (Neighmond). </p>

<p>The Seattle study is far from an outlier.  The systematic review of school start time research 
compiled by Minges and Redeker revealed similar results (Minges and Redeker 87).  Their study 
began with 1035 articles, with Minges and Redeker gradually eliminating argues based on criteria 
that did not meet their criteria or were “duplicates” (Minges and Redeker).  When their systematic 
review concluded, Minges and Redeker reported that "There was a significant positive net change 
in all studies, indicating an increase in the total minutes of sleep"(87).  Moreover, they found that 
this change was significant, writing that "The net increase ranged from an additional 25 minutes 
to 77 minutes of sleep per weeknight"(Minges and Redeker 87).  By combining the results of so 
many studies Minges and Redeker reinforce the idea that delayed school start times result in 
adolescents receiving significantly more sleep each school night. </p>

 <p>In addition to connecting school start times with improved sleep Minges and Redeker were 
able to establish a trend in their studies that showed “decreases in the depression scale, depressed 
mood score, and proportion of students who were irritated or annoyed” (93).  The academic effects 
of delayed school start times have also been studied.  In a study conducted by Jeffrey Groen and 
Sabrina Pabilonia from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, they claimed that "We find that an extra 
hour of sleep on a weekday leads to a 0.36 standard deviation increase in the broad reading test 
score for female students.  Overall, these results imply that the female students who are getting 
more sleep when schools start later are the ones who benefit in terms of higher test scores (Groen 
and Pablionia 214). </p>

            <h3 style="background-color: rgba(87, 130, 170, 0.87); padding: 10px;"> The evidence linking delayed school start times to academic achievement should be the impetus for parents to make sure their 
                    children utilize their delayed school start times to sleep in. </h3>

            <h2>Argument</h2>
               <h3>"While the health and academics of my child may be important, delayed school start times will negativly affect their after school responsibilities."</h3>

               <div style="background-color: rgba(245, 245, 220, 0.281); border-radius: 50px; padding: 20px; border: solid black 2px;">


                    <h2>Counterargument</h2>


               <p> Minges and Redeker determined that after-school  
                    activities were not affected by the delayed school start time (Minges and Redeker 93).  Moreover, 
                    Groen and Pablionia concluded that “With later start times, students are not any more or less likely 
                    to hold a job or spend time at work” (215).  For many students who rely heavily on their jobs, 
                    being mindful of their commonly hectic work schedule is certainly apropos. These results show 
                    that a delayed school start time does not affect a student's job, supporting the claim that it is 
                    possible to have a delayed school start time without severely compromising a student's work schedule.

                   <p> Groen and Pablionia’s study also found that when delayed school start times were 
                    implemented, female students increased the amount of time they dedicated to sports after school, 
                    running counterintuitive to the suggestion that delayed school start times negatively affect after 
                    school activities (213).</p>
