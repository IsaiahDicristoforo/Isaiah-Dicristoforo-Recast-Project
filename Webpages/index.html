            <p>

                    On November 1, 2019, California's Governor, Gavin Newsom, implemented a new law
                    that required California high schools to start at 8:30 a.m. or later (Hauser and Kwai). The New
                    York Times reported that “The passage of the law followed years of mounting calls for later
                    school start times from sleep experts who said such a move would optimize learning, reduce
                    tardiness and contribute to a student's overall well-being" (Hauser and Kwai). The law has
                    garnered support from sleep experts, teachers, and students.

            <h2>Aaron E. Carroll, Parent:</h2>
               <blockquote> "My oldest child, Jacob, is in 10th grade. He plays on the junior varsity tennis team, but 
                    his life isn’t consumed by too many extracurricular activities. He’s a hard worker, and he 
                    spends a fair amount of time each evening doing homework. I think most nights he’s 
                    probably asleep by 10 or 10:30. His school bus picks him up at 6:40 a.m. To catch it, he 
                    needs to wake up not long after 6. Nine hours of sleep is a pipe dream, let alone 10 
                    (Carroll)." </blockquote>
