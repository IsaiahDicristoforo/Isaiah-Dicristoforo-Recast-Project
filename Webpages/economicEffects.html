                    <h3>While the paramount reason for delaying school start times should be to improve student's 
                        sleep, there is evidence that shows a long-term economic gain for school districts. </h3>

    <p>
        The American Academy of Pediatrics admits that while delayed school start times could 
    initially have a negative economic impact on a school, <blockquote>"Because the appropriation of federal dollars 
    for schools is partially dependent on student attendance data, reducing tardiness and absenteeism 
    levels could result in increased funding and further offset costs related to moving start times later (Owens 647)."</blockquote>

                The nonprofit research institution, the RAND Corporation, conducted a study that analyzed 
                the economic implications when a school delayed its start time (Hafner et al. 3). The study’s lead 
                author, Economist Marcos Halfner, wrote that "The study estimates changes in the economic 
                performance of 47 U.S. states following a delayed school start time, which includes the benefits 
                of higher academic performance of students and reduced car crash rate” (Hafner et al. 3). 
                Halfner et al. summarized, “Even after just two years, the study projects an economic gain 
                of $8.6 billion to the U.S. economy, which would already outweigh the costs per student from delaying school start times to 8:30 a.m” (Hefner et al. 3). </p>

                <div style="background-color: rgba(245, 245, 220, 0.281); border-radius: 50px; padding: 20px; border: solid black 2px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
            
        
                    <p>This study suggests that there is an 
                     economic incentive for implementing delayed school start times.   While opponents of delayed 
                     school start times can correctly argue that school districts will suffer additional expenditures the 
                     evidence presented here strongly refutes the claim that these initial economic downsides will have 
                     a negative long-term impact.  As the study's authors explain, the financial benefit of delayed school 
                     start times is mostly a result of a student doing better at school and being more alert on the road 
                     (Hefner et al. 3).    These two effects are due to the increased sleep a student will receive as a result 
                     of a delayed school start time (Hefner et al. 3).  Provided that this train of thought will be continued 
                     to be supported by further studies, the RAND corporation presents a strong argument that the 
                     positive effects gained from a delayed school start time could result in a positive long-term 
                     economic impact. </p>
